        But the one in front of the gun lives forever (the one in front of the gun, forever)
        And I been hustlin' all-day, this-a-way, that-a-way
        Through canals and alleyways, just to say
        Money trees is the perfect place for shade, and that's jus' how I feel
        Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch
        That's jus' how I feel, nah

        That Louis Burgers never be the same (won't be the same, won't be the same)
        A Louis belt that never ease that pain (won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
        But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (that day is jerkin', day is jerkin')
        Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin', Pirellis skirtin')
        Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
        Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)

        If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
        From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin', Blood
        Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs, but it's all good
        Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
        Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
        In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
        Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree
